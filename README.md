# US Immigration Case Processing Dashboard

A data analysis project exploring how USCIS handles different types of immigration cases across various U.S. regions. This dashboard helps legal professionals and applicants understand processing delays and optimize application planning.

## 🔍 Motivation
As a paralegal working in immigration law, I noticed a significant discrepancy in how long cases take across offices. This project aims to make such patterns visible using public data.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn)
- Tableau
- Public USCIS data
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 📊 Key Findings
- Vermont Service Center processes I-130 cases slower than Nebraska.
- H-1B cases spiked in 2022 Q3, with corresponding delays.
- Some offices consistently outperform others.
